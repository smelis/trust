I've seen JD grow older in public for longer than she's been alive, and I read every tabloid headline about him and Kate Moss. That he liked his wine, and occasional drug was unquestionably so, but none of his exes have said a bad word about him. And when he and Vanessa Paradis (he has a type) had children he so very obviously changed and matured as a man and a person.\n\nTrack records are a thing.\n\nTo add to that, I've unfortunately have experienced a relationship with a narcissist, and she exhibits all the signs of being one.\n\nEta: also the timing of her #metoo article. It seemed such an obvious surfboard on a wave.",

That\u2019s what she\u2019s got??? specifically, because, as I get the impression you and I are roughly contemporaries, I know, full well, that first of all nobody makes that tattoo change, unless they did it with a sense of humor; also, people have literally been making fun over it for decades. \n\nI tried telling her born-yesterday nitwits that\u2026 It\u2019s like I have never spoken. \n\nThey go mute, and/or run away from me.\n\nBut I know full well, for 20 to 15 years every single interview, he did mentioned it, as did 20% of Winona's, and approximately 2500 general articles on break ups and celebrity tattoos... he is absolutely past being angry over it.

Nearly 5 million people signed a petition to have her removed and that was pre trial. \n\nLook at how badly The Flash bombed. AQ2 has been delayed for years, had it's release date changed 3 times. \n\nAs someone already pointed out Barnaby Joyce is no longer Deputy P.M. and it's been almost a decade. If something were going to happen it would have already happened. \nJust my 02.\n\nEdit: what's up with using the pic of her from 2012? Did the mainstream media make this post?",

The average person can disappear from the abuser\u2019s view and therefore escape from them. I moved far away from mine, because yes, he would never give up. \n\nBut Johnny can\u2019t do that. He has, however, done all the right things to avoid her continuing wrath but he\u2019s a celeb so he\u2019ll never be able to fully escape her eye. \n\nThe best thing that could happen is that she fall for someone else in a serious way, then her target moves from him to the new guy/gal at least some of it. \n\nMy ex is remarried but he\u2019ll still take a shot if one opens up for him and I\u2019m 15 years post divorce. They never quit. There really should be stronger legal consequences for these things but so far there really isn\u2019t.  The more you fight them, the more they have to win.",

I can\u2019t say I know a ton about the Farrow Allen thing so correct me if I\u2019m wrong but I thought he was on his Mom\u2019s side on their abuse allegations toward his Dad and they hadn\u2019t successfully proven it as of yet. \n\nThat doesn\u2019t seem to square with me that he would side with Amber in her case but maybe he didn\u2019t do his homework on the Depp Heard case at all. \n\nIf he did, he should be siding with Johnny who very narrowly escaped being labeled the abuser due to PROOF. \n\nIn both cases nobody should be labeled an abuser without something to decisively back it up and not made up and staged photos, but something. I\u2019d much rather an abuser walk then be accused, tried in the public eye and convicted of it without proof. \n\nI know all about how hard it is to prove. I married an abuser. I didn\u2019t have proof so I didn\u2019t even try to go there in my divorce even though I could have and perhaps should have but it wasn\u2019t worth it to me to try. \n\nMy ex is a master manipulator and even without \u2018going there\u2019 he actually cried in court over my supposedly not giving him more time with the kids. (He did get more time if the kids wanted it and all the time he agreed to).  I never saw the man cry even when his Father died during our marriage. But of course he was a better actor than Amber who had to pretend there were tears. It worked on the judge, too, who chastised me but the law was on my side on this so my ex got nothing out of that hearing. \n\nIt\u2019s a very complicated thing, but people cannot knee jerk react to abuse allegations as always true or always false. From a legal perspective you have to prove it. What Amber did was prove SHE was the abuser. That\u2019s what sticks in her craw. Lol",

Furthermore, there are indications Ronan only joined the fray about Harvey specifically to take down Allen, because of how much Mia has essentially molded him since 1992. Regardless of where you are regarding the Woody/Mia/Soon-Yi affair (and in my personal opinion I have sympathy with neither Mia nor Woody and find both of them despicable), Mia's side has always had their thumb on the scale, and Ronan is emblematic of it. In short, Ronan is not an actual journalist, but only got where he is because of nepotism and Mia pulling strings for him.",

Either she HAD NO more content & was stringing all us Depp fans along, or she was to lazy to write it.

I unsubbed from her substack & now a year later she wants to bring us back in with some crumbs & another \u201cStay Tuned\u201d promise!!\nNO THANKS!!   \nAnyone want real Depp content, stick to the OG\u2019s:   The Umbrella Guy, Brian & Jax (Incredibly Average & Movies, Myths & Monsters) The Real Laura B, Les & Stevie J Raw.  So many terrific YouTube creators who have been a part of this case since it\u2019s inception.  I prefer to show my appreciation to the ones who poured their blood, sweat and tears into this community and not waste my time & energy on some Right winged propagandist & fringe conspiracy theorist.  \nSo no, HouseInHabit, this time I will NOT \u201cstay tuned\u201d!",

Especially those who are like he faked everything and anyone who believes/supports him deserve any bad treatment they get. And now so many people are like you should watch the documentary thing on netflix... Im like i watched the actual trial both on courttv and on the channels i just mentioned. Why watch something someone literally cut and pasted together to fit their own agenda?",

In its various mutation it's employed by investigative journalists, documentary feature makers, and imaginative dramatists. So we shouldn't be surprised when programs as various as Culloden and Oppenheimer or Suez, or Cabinet reconstructions refuse tidy and comprehensive definition.[4]\n\nDocudramas producers use literary and narrative techniques to flesh out the bare facts of an event in history to tell a story. Some degree of license is often taken with minor historical facts for the sake of enhancing the drama. Docudramas are distinct from historical fiction, in which the historical setting is a mere backdrop for a plot involving fictional characters.[1]\n\nThe scholar Steven N. Lipkin considers docudrama as a form of performance through recollection which in turn shapes our collective memory of past events. It is a mode of representation.[5] Educator Benicia D'sa maintained that docudramas are heavily impacted by filmmakers' own perspectives and understanding of history.[6]",

People \"like\" stuff, not necessarily because they actually do, but because they want to be liked back or followed back or whatever  \nAnd Ebay has made a mockery of customer ratings because that's all lies too. ie If there are five possible stars and you buy something that arrives in good condition and in reasonable time that should be a three star not a five star performance because it is precisely what you paid for that what you expected - nothing more and nothing less. But to force 5 star ratings for average performance leaves no reward for truly excellent performance and therefore no incentive to deliver it  \nThe Influencers so many love to follow are mostly liars too and corporate suck ups too and all for clicks and clout and money and the fawning of adoring followers. The \"new\" version of thinking for yourself seems to only involve choosing which Influencer to think for you  \nSo there we have it. It appears that Lies are the New Truth",

I think they're banking on this so she can come back in time for the next Aquaman release date.",

The lingering reaction to the docu will be sympathy to an \"imperfect victim\". Even on reddit, which was largely pro-JD during the trial just a year ago, you will see comments defending her. The audio of her mocking Johnny should be replayed periodically so everyone remembers.",

Just because Camille and/or Ben say a book or a documentary is okay (Netflix, Nick Wallis...) and don't trash it for some reason is no reason to doubt them and their loyalty or belief in Johnny.\n\nBen and Camille and the whole team had to put together all their questions, opening/closing statements, objections, and so on, so don't tell me they didn't work their tails off.",

There was something about the timing with Isaac seeing wine on the walls that I couldn\u2019t figure out.\n\nIt sucks that maybe Ben and Camille didn\u2019t do the best job they could\u2019ve done. I\u2019m wondering if because of ties to Elon, they purposely dropped the ball in critical areas that would\u2019ve exposed him/stepped on his toes. Amber truly lost the case for herself. Full credit to Camille for a killer cross examination, but Amber\u2019s bad acting, bs pictures, and nonsensical stories were what really did her in.",

The witness statements - everything.\n\nThe Isaac wine discussion comes about, because between the time he left to go out and meet a friend, picked up dinner, and came back, red wine had all of a sudden made its way onto the walls of the hallway. \n\nThe red was not on the walls when Isaac went downstairs: but he did think the walls were wet, if I recall correctly.\n\nAnyway, Johnny left after the phone throwing and whatever happened in the Amber walk in closet penthouse; the first pair of cops showed up; they went all around and talked to Amber, and could find no signs or proof of the devastation that Amber would later go on to claim in court.\n\nSo, after the visit of cops team number one, cops number two wind up being called because cops number one had not caused a distinct enough sensation to please Amber's lust for guaranteed divorce blackmail material... after which she and Josh, Rocky etc went all around and messed the place up a second time, including strewing red wine up and down the hallway wallpaper and or carpet.\n\nWe know it was not there the first time around, because you can see the body worn cop camera on the first pair of cops... which we only learned about after the UK trial, it not having been surrendered by the LAPD in enough time.\n\nwe also know that the wine (a) showing up; (b), being red, only in time for the second set of LAPD cops to show up, happened; because for a corroborating set of information, when Josh, Rocky, and or Amber are all explaining Johnny\u2019s 'temper tantrum', they first start out saying it was 'red wine'... but it wasn't.\n\nOnce they realize that there was no wine within the hallways that was visible (because Isaac saw none when he went downstairs to seek his dinner, and thus would have noticed it), her merry band of scammers both say 'oh, it wasn't red wine. It was champagne!', \n\nbecause (a), champagne isn\u2019t going to show up on the carpet, when people finally get around to being able to look at the body worn camera, it being basically the same color as water for the Indifferent and largely black and white LAPD camera quality purposes, they (b), go into the halls and LAY DOWN a trail of red wine... which Johnny never touched. \n\nBy the time Isaac comes back Upstairs, he has missed all of this fun and games: and the only thing he knows is that red wine has now suddenly appeared on the walls and carpet - where there had been no red wine when he left to go downstairs the last time.\n\nTL:DR: when there needs to be visible wine strewn up and down the walls and the carpet of the ECB, there is none.\n\nOnly after have the cops, Isaac, etc., been told \u201cno no no: there was all this mess around here. The first time you showed up \u2013 you all just didn\u2019t/couldn\u2019t SEE it' - do the scammers look around and say \u201choly shit, we gotta make this place look exactly the way we told the cops it looked, before they (second pair of cops) get here!\u201c",

Also, I know the Australia aftermath audio couldn't be used because of Jerry Judge, but, why didn't they ask Kipper and Debbie about Their portion in that audio??? Also, there are SO many photos of Johnny with marks that weren't used!! Why didn't Camille press harder on the 59 texts in 2 hours and the 2nd text tirades which ended with Amber texting Johnny \"I'm at the house trying to find a way in\"??? There is so much evidence left out. It's sad.",

Elon was a material witness, probably the most important one, yet Ben & Camille never went after him to lock down his testimony.   *Videos & photos of Musk visiting Heard mysteriously vanished.   **Camille & Ben publicly supporting Nick Vaills book.  A book that is totally skewed pro-amber.   ***B&C never using pertinent evidence that Adam gave them.   There\u2019s a lot more.   \nWhoa!!   Adam accusing B & C of chasing 15 minutes of fame & calling them \u201cTV lawyers\u201d.   \n\nEveryone saying what a dynamite job C & B did.  (Keep in mind Johnny paid them a shit ton of money. ). Yes they did their jobs, what they were paid to do, but they also sat on exculpatory evidence.  \n\nAdam always has & always will be the one guy that Johnnys best interest in mind.

So this is taken very seriously.\n\nIt does not mean however that you can't represent two people that have some sort of \"conflict\". You just can't represent them against each other. Meaning the fact that the firm that represents EM in Trial A doesn't mean they can't represent JD in Trial B als long as the two aren't interconnected. \n\nKeep in mind: Lawyers do this as a job. They are used to this. It's one case out of many. And rarely is information from one case used in another if you're the person working both cases; hardly ever if at all is it used when it's different lawyers. And if there's any danger of possibly conflicting interests in the future, chinese walls are put up (meaning branch A is representing A, branch B is representing B and NO information, absolutely ZERO can pass between the branches regarding those to cases. Oh and believe me, it's taken seriously)",

Does that help JD case?\n\nIMO, take down Elmo via this lawsuit will make JD look petty in front of the jury esp in light of those txt messages, even JD had all the emotional reason to.\n\nIf Jax are feeling so strong she should share that 70s pages doc.

The firm even has an office outside the US in London, England which tells me of some their size and reach too. \n\nI\u2019m not sure what year whatever documents Jax is saying went missing was losses. I\u2019m missing a lot of context to this conversation. It\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve heard of 70k documents leaked. I had heard of Johnny\u2019s large amount of text messages leaked in the Sun UK case though, by accident. I\u2019m not sure if Jax is talking about that. \n\nBut I think Johnny basically fired Brown Rudnick at the point when the text messages were accidentally leaked, just a few months from the Sun UK trial. Then he appointed an English lawyer instead, who I believe had his own firm. \n\nBrown Rudnick shifted over to the Amber Heard/US trial at that point I think, which I have the sense was Adam Waldman\u2019s case, primarily? Not clear on this. Adam Waldman attended the Sun UK trial in its entirety, though, I think, while Ben Chew stayed in the US. \n\nHowever at some point (Sun UK trial? Or the retrial Johnny wanted) Adam Waldman was reprimanded for whatever he shared to the press (recordings? Statements?) and I forget what the consequence of that was\u2014was he fired? \n\nAnyway, I think there was some shifting of hands about things. Having three law firms in the mix (Brown Rudnick, Adam Waldman, and the English lawyer\u2019s) probably complicates things, as well as the divorce lawyers which was also a different and fourth firm from a previous year. I remember during Laura Wasser\u2019s (?) deposition testimony played during trial that it was her firm that had asked for the penthouse security tapes. \n\nI do also recall in some document that Ben Chew of Brown Rudnick said they did have many hours of security tape showing Amber. \n\nElon\u2019s involvement also did appear to be a motion in Limine issue that was mentioned during one of the sidebars or preliminary matters I think in the first two days of official transcripts. \n\nAnyway, whatever Jax is saying, and im not sure I understand what the 70k documents is in reference to, it\u2019s not a good look to make it appear as if Brown Rudnick and Adam Waldman are at odds with each other. Ben Chew and Adam did seem to get along pretty well during Adam\u2019s deposition which Ben conducted. \n\nI feel as though the answer to Elon not being seen in the elevator probably amounts to him not having been properly subpoenaed to testify. I heard during some Lawtube stream that there were lawyers camped out at Elon\u2019s place trying to serve him, but they didn\u2019t manage to. I don\u2019t know what source of this there is but Elon certainly is rich enough to evade even tactics such as serving him on an airplane\u2014not that Elon ever needs to fly in a commercial plane in his life!",

But the facts are these: some of Mr. Depp's legal dream team of five Hollywood lawyers reviewed the entire surveillance video library taken of Ms. Heard, her friends, Elon Musk and others captured by 24 surveillance cameras in the Eastern Columbia Building and the 87 surveillance videos that these lawyers set aside.  \n'Then Mr. Depp's lawyers took sworn declarations from multiple eyewitnesses. Some on Mr. Depp's legal team secretly represented Elon Musk. Some of Mr. Depp's legal team then hid for nearly three years this exculpatory evidence from Mr. Depp that disproved the malicious hoax perpetrated against him by Amber Heard.'  \nBloom & Co. have denied all allegations of wrongdoing and insisted they never conspired against the actor.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nthe problem is... none of the above is precise.\n\n\"**The** lawyers, \"**the**\" legal dream team\" - Ben and Camille don't and didn't ever (AFAIK - I could be wrong) work for the Bloom law firm; and considering what we know about the Brown Rudnick team, Jacob Bloom's law firm could ABSOLUTELY have had \"a dream team of five Hollywood lawyers\" from their team ALONE, (a) working on Johnny's divorce; (b) looking at this stuff - hell, Brown Rudnick brought like eight attorneys to/into the VA trial alone.\n\n(Aside: I also note I remember someone saying they thought Jacob Bloom lost, or maybe that should be \"lost\", the punch footage; which dovetails a lot closer with the above recollection.)",

If their strategy was different than Adam's, nothing wrong with that.   They won.   \n\nIf their legal firm - international one - also represented Elon some where, that did not stop them from including Elon's texts to AH and her's to him in the trial, and asking witnesses had they seen Elon visit Amber.    Someone said that videos of him in building had gotten \"lost\" so suspicious that the legal firm \"lost them\" or some such gossip, I don't know.   Who cares???    The texts and her dating him right after the actual split are enough.   Having Franco over that night was enough too. They didn't leave Elon out of the trial.",

But that's because unfortunately, this is what generates clicks.\n\nBut his live streams are the most interesting content he puts out, in my opinion\n\nI found this bit about Deuters interesting.  Basically what happened is that the texts could not be introduced unless they agreed to have Deuters testify, and AH counsel did not want to open that particular can of worms.  So instead they just leaked the texts to the public.\n\nAnd if you decide to listen to the whole thing, I had to agree with his stance.  He says that they are trying very hard to rewrite history and they will most likely succeed.  People here remember the trial, but the average attention span being what it is, most people will forget and simply accept the new narrative over time.",

It\u2019s in code. So I believe that therapist\u2019s comment in the video who said \u201cit\u2019s clearly a layperson\u2019s idea of what a therapist\u2019s notes look like.\u201d",

So why not start with the truth first? That maybe AH was the one trying to get false evidence admitted? I learned absolutely nothing new and still don\u2019t have a different opinion that AH is guilty and JD is innocent. Reliving her testimony made me sick to my stomach\u2026 she is a horrible actress. I don\u2019t have a sliver of doubt in my mind that she made the whole thing up. I also don\u2019t think Johnny is an Angel but I think she was so evil and vile with her actions towards him. I wish someone would do a documentary on the people that believe AH\u2026 I think the majority of these people are unhinged and jaded towards men in general.",

I don't care if he was really drunk on the plane.\n\nWhat I care about are the incidents she claimed he punched her - repeatedly in some claims.   Did he ever use his fists on her, knock her around....   That is what I wanted to know.   I don't care about them pushing/shoving each other.  I don't care about some accidental headbutt.   Or allegedly getting hit by some cell phone on their last day together. She alleges he beat her up.   I wanted to know if he was hitting her.    I believe Johnny, that he never struck her.",

I think I have a good capability to really be fair and hear both sides without judgement but at some point, I had to discredit everything she said. At first, I believed her and that was sad for me because I have always liked JD as an actor. Then the calls were released and I was shocked. I felt sad as a society, we sided with her without knowing the facts. I know now that she is and was the abuser. I can say that with all the confidence in the world but everyone is entitled to feel the way they feel.",

                "comment_text": "I saw it.  Or rather, I skimmed it. It struck me as very clever piece of propaganda, implying a great deal while making few truth claims that could be disproven.\n\nIt implied, in a word, that AH was robbed through a combination of bad bench rulings and a misleading frame imposed on the public, including the jury, by clout-chasing hobbyists with axes to grind.\n\nIn service of that stealth argument, the producers curated trial footage to show AH at her most convincing, JD at his most flippant, Camille Vasquez at her meanest, and new-media content creators at their most amateurish. If their footage were viewed in a vacuum, they'd probably carry their point.\n\n* Hearing AH's voice break while alleging spousal SA would be very moving -- if inconsistencies in her story hadn't already caused you to doubt it.\n* JD would look like a giant dick for smirking during his ex's testimony -- if he'd done it constantly, as the footage suggests, rather than at isolated moments over the course of a six-week trial.\n* Camille Vasquez would indeed look like an assassin for demanding of AH, \"You're the real monster in this relationship\" -- if hours upon hours of cross-examination hadn't led you to a comparable, if slightly more nuanced, conclusion.\n* And, yeah, the American public would look like one big basket of deplorables for tuning into clowns like Asmongold and Darth News (sp?) -- if consumers revered their buffooneries as *ex cathedra* pronouncements.  Which, as far as I can tell, nobody did or does.\n\nThe catch with propaganda is that it does require a vacuum.  To make it stick, you must either toss all contrary evidence down the memory hole or compel people to believe it by some species of force.  As Stalin's and Beria's names don't appear in the credits, the producers will have their work cut out for them with Plan B.  And something tells me Elon Musk isn't going to be much help with Plan A.\n\nTo end by offering the producers a nugget of praise, they did, to my mind, go some distance toward re-humanizing AH.  A clear recording of her infamous dare, \"Tell the world...\" makes her sound as though she's using \"man\" as an interjection, not to remind JD why the world will never believe he's been abused.  That shouldn't tempt anyone to reassess the verdict, but it does make her sound a little less like a poster girl for double standards.\n\nAlso, just as JD didn't spend the whole trial mugging for the cameras, or for Ben Chew, she didn't spend the whole trial smirking like [Salome.](https://www.pinterest.es/pin/490822059368756247/)  For the most part, they both looked grave, not to say stressed.  Who wouldn't?",

I don't think anyone walked away from that trial with empathy for her at all, even if they still didn't support JD. It's also absurd to boost this narrative about the YouTubers when every major news and entertainment outlet carried the trial in full with commentary. Every entity made ad money or super chat money off of it, so no one can wag their fingers like they were above it. I actually think it's more irresponsible to have stubborn opinions about things they've only read in viral tweet threads, Reddit or clips on social media. That's what should've been highlighted, as well as the dangerous implications of believing all accusations without further investigation and substantiated evidence.",

It only refreshes people's questions on why it wasn't used / verified for the US trial.",

Admission is the first step towards recovery. Glad we established that.\n\nIMMEDIATELY CANCELED HER??\n\nAre they SERIOUS? For six YEARS Amber was given attention over lies. Johnny was immediately canceled by Disney within four days of her OpEd being published. They didn\u2019t give him the benefit of the doubt. They didn\u2019t consider that he\u2019d worked with them for more than two decades, and earned them over a billion dollars. They didn\u2019t even hold a conversation before they stripped him of HIS character that made them the most money, and he learned about it with the rest of the public. Johnny was betrayed by Hollywood. WB strong-armed him into resigning from SoD. \n\nAmber was canceled because she earned that herself. She lied, accepted money as a paid speaker as a liar, and committed fraud. She should be in prison for fraud, extortion, and domestic violence. \n\nLet\u2019s be real. Will Smith was very wrong for what he did. He publicly slapped Chris Rock. He felt immediate remorse. He was still canceled. We don\u2019t see nearly any (new) positive stories. All we see is the aftermath of that slap. We see the dynamics in his marriage. MSM has turned their back on him. For a slap. Again, not condoning it at all, but what Will did was so much smaller in comparison to what Amber has done, yet MSM is constantly sharing the most mundane stories of positivity they can muster. \u201cHere\u2019s Amber buying books!\u201d \u201cAmber loves Spain.\u201d\n\nWe don\u2019t care.\n\nAmber was treated differently BECAUSE she\u2019s a woman, and idgaf if that makes me sound misogynistic. Feminism shouldn\u2019t be about siding with women even if they are violent predators. We want equality, not a free pass to reverse the roles of abuse.\n\nCanceled? That\u2019s not good enough. Toss her in the basement and forget about her. \n\nDo they give Weinstein the benefit of doubt? How about RKelly? Danny Masterson? Toss them in the basement too.",

It\u2019s stated on several DV/IPV websites that the average abused individual leaves their partner 7-12 times before they leave for the last time. I\u2019m not sure how many times they broke up and got back together, but I feel like it\u2019s a lot. There\u2019s likely a pretty solid reason.",

I can\u2019t remember offhand who she was, maybe her acting coach? She mentioned that Amber\u2019s weight kept going up and down, where sometimes she looked skeletal. The problem is, once you take away how they can make her look with effects and makeup, her lack of acting skills is a problem. She couldn\u2019t even hack it on a daytime soap it\u2019s so bad.\n\n\nNotice how she blamed London Fields on Johnny, he didn\u2019t want her working? Sooo many people haven\u2019t seen him taking pictures of her at The Danish Girl premiere. He looks pretty proud to me.

                        "comment_text": "Jada never should have had that show to begin with. She used her platform to further abuse Willow. Publicly talked about how *she* felt when Willow expressed natural emotions. I think she\u2019s made that whole family miserable for YEAAAAAAARRRRRSSS.\n\nI think Jada\u2019s been containing her family in little boxes for a really long time, to where she owns Will and he knows it. He could never in a million years afford to divorce her. He\u2019s too deep in her abuse to even want to try. If their marriage ends it will be because she\u2019s done with him. He\u2019s her puppet.\n\nThat whole \u201cWill and I have a relationship that\u2019s grown\u201d was more about her continuously stepping out of their marriage than him. The way she said to makes it sound like monogamous relationship aren\u2019t mature ones. She\u2019s the leader and he falls in line.\n\nI think that\u2019s why he laughed at first until he saw her face. It\u2019s not the first time Chris has made a dig at Jada, but he\u2019s also a comedian. Will should know full and well that it\u2019s what comedians DO. Jada? She needs to chill tf out. She should know Chris better to know it wasn\u2019t malicious. How many Madagascar films are there? How many of those projects did they do together? \n\nPeople clapping at his expense is gross, and there no excuse for that that at all, and if Will\u2019s apology was superficial then I recant my statement.\n\nI\u2019m not giving him a free pass, so please don\u2019t assume that I am. He deserves what consequences he\u2019s received for his behavior and actions. He\u2019s honestly lucky he wasn\u2019t arrested. \n\nChris Rock didn\u2019t deserve to be assaulted. I\u2019m not suggesting for a minute that he did. What I\u2019m saying is that when you compare what Will did to Amber? He\u2019s fucked for a LONG time. Did he earn it? Sure, but why is what he did that much worse to MSM? Why is what he did worse to Hollywood than Amber in general?\n\nI\u2019m not overly convinced Amber\u2019s been \u201ccanceled\u201d because of what she did to Johnny. I think people are afraid to hire her because they don\u2019t want their projects to tank. Her acting is atrocious. People don\u2019t overly enjoy working with her. She wants too much money because she holds herself to far too high of a standard for her skillset. She\u2019s quickly losing that \u201cgirl next door\u201d beauty, so she\u2019s not going to have that \u201chot body\u201d to help her land anything. She doesn\u2019t have Johnny anymore to help her get auditions for bigger roles. She\u2019s been in the industry for nearly 20 years. She\u2019s had projects with some pretty huge names, yet none of them were chomping at the bit to work with her again before she landed Mera. Even then Jason wanted her replaced. Their onscreen chemistry was atrocious, but they INSISTED on keeping her. Those are the things hurting her. \n\nNot that she\u2019s openly admitted to assaulting him on multiple occasions. Disfigured his hand for life. Put a cigarette out on his face. Maliciously lied using the Me Too movement and media as her tools. She STILL has the ACLU backing her (which I\u2019m pretty positive is a cover for hate groups because they openly assist the KKK and other legit hate groups). She only recently lost L\u2019Or\u00e9al with the help of her cultists. WB still hasn\u2019t issued any formal statements that they removed her from A2. They should have and could have immediately issued a statement following the trial results, but they didn\u2019t. MSM still posts these ridiculous stories in her favor. Every documentary out there makes Johnny look like he\u2019s the perpetrator and she\u2019s the victim. No one has recanted a single thing. She\u2019s not getting hired for acting gigs, but he still isn\u2019t either. She\u2019s damaged his reputation beyond repair yet we get to see her positive articles on the regular? It\u2019s disgusting and I hate it. \n\nWe all know into the dumpster fire didn\u2019t do well at the festival, but they still did Jeanne du Barry dirty. They changed the show times at the last minute for what was a sold out showing. Then posted photos of a nearly empty theater to her benefit. She shows up to a crowd for Indiana Jones, and claims the people cheering are cheering for her. Most of us know damn well they thought she was someone else, and that she was part of the Indiana Jones film, but she exploited the moment, and the media helped her do it. They made it sound like Amber was just so fearful to attend the festival, so they added extra security. It\u2019s a joke. A spectacle. \n\nSo what really makes Amber so damn special? That\u2019s what I want to know. What makes an abusive, lying, fraud of a woman so important? Someone who was previously arrested for assault. One who may have drugged young aspiring actresses with MDMA for sex parties for the wealthy. One who put an entire ecosystem at risk due to her entitlement, and then lied about that too. Someone who is walking around with a misdiagnosis that is bought and paid for, unchecked, with a child. A child which, let\u2019s be real, is little more than a publicity tool.",

'Why do they have to recontextualize it?\")\n\nHer tone made me realize that the producers have poked a bear.

I've kept up with almost every thing out of personal interest and if I\u2019m not mistaken, the Netflix 3 episode docuseries is a deeper, comprehensive view of the trial. \n\nI do like how the testimonies are being played side by side, though. Like Australia for example, Heard was shown explaining her side, then it immediately cuts to Depp explaining his side. That theme plays through the entire thing so far.",

Why she wasn\u2019t allowed to have \u201call the evidence\u201d, the \u201creal story\u201d about the plane, how court docs were released and people started \u201cturning on Depp\u201d. I was shocked & irritated in the end because I too followed the entire thing from 2016 TRA to watching the trial every single day. \n\nIt seemed like they were being balanced, but then it became a criticism game & started to feel quite biased. I\u2019ll have to really sit down at my computer and share my thoughts because it\u2019s too much to try and convey via my phone at 5am my time \ud83d\ude05\ud83e\udd23",

                "comment_text": "I\u2019ve finished 2/3 episodes and I can say it\u2019s biased towards Amber Heard.  They put the testimonies and some of the witnesses side by side to somehow make it seem like \u201cthey\u2019re being fair\u201d but here\u2019s my observations\n\n1) Railed against the trial by social media. We all know it was heavily skewed towards Johnny at the time but them making it seem like \u201cyou can\u2019t know the truth because they\u2019re both actors\u201d and because of the trial by SM.  I think it is totally an unfair characterization. I\u2019m speaking for myself and a lot of the feedback I read at the time that most people assumed Amber was abused during the #metoo hey day but have been opened to the truth once we started watching the trial. They really kept hammering that collectively the tubers made millions form the content creation.\n\n2) There\u2019s a lot of lawtubers at the time but they showed clips of Christopher Melcher multiple times which he seemed somewhat biased against Johnny. One particular clip that I did not like and I don\u2019t know if it was being taken out of context (since they only picked and chose some clips) is when he described trial jury as more of a \u201ctheater.\u201d He said it isn\u2019t about the truth or right or wrong. It\u2019s about what the judge and jury believes.  They even repeated this quote from him.  I think it\u2019s a disgrace and an attack on our justice system.  What he didn\u2019t say is that each jury member must individually assess the evidence and witnesses testimony and collectively deliver a unanimous decision.\n\n3) Again, showing Christopher Melcher\u2019s comments on Amber\u2019s video of Johnny smashing the cabinets. He basically said that if Johnny was that aggressive, it is abuse! That smashing cabinets is abuse if that\u2019s how she felt!\ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\n4) I particularly did not appreciate when Netflix seems to be defending Amber Heard on interchangeably using \u201cpledged\u201d vs \u201cdonated.\u201d They showed multiple articles using pledged or donated.  They also showed that Amber made $1.3M payments to the ACLU and 2 $350k payments to Children\u2019s Hospital. Since the series is current, they could have validated if Amber Turd made any more payments.    They missed to point out that the Turd said she wanted nothing but out of the $7M she received, she\u2019s only paid $2M so she kept the majority of the divorce money.\n\n5) I also did not like that they seem to side with Heard that the poop on the bed was dog poop as they seem to keep hammering the point that Amber raised in her testimony that Boo ate Johnny\u2019s drugs and she ended up with bowel issues. They showed multiple TikTok videos showing the same and even showed in one video Amber saying that Boo pooped all over Johnny before the Turd on the bed. \n\n6) I do love that they kept showing the clips of Amber\u2019s testimony, in succession too. Because whatever Netflix is trying to do, if they want to change the public opinion, they\u2019re going to fail because of those testimony clips. Just like during the trial, Amber Turd cannot act to save her life. Her lies became more evident because of her own words and testimonies.",

Instead they put words on the screen that Amber said she was sexually assaulted.  \n\nThis, for me, is the most heinous of her lies. They should have pointed out that being assaulted with a bottle is so graphic and brutal but it was Johnny who ended up in the hospital. At least they showed his bloody finger.",

I know I\u2019m not popular for saying this, but I don\u2019t enjoy the ridicule. I will admit some of it is funny though, but it shouldn\u2019t be out there. \nAaaanyway, the doc was okay, but it\u2019s not good enough to draw a conclusion as it left out a lot. And there were some useless details. It didn\u2019t go in depth. Unless you are lazy *cough cough* you should rather watch the trial and read documents.",

He is the epitome of what a musical theater teacher told our class once: \u201cSometimes, you will go to an audition and hear the most amazing voice from behind the scenes. You will feel discouraged and sometimes give up. What you missed was there was nothing behind the voice. It was beautiful\u2026but the expression was blank. Don\u2019t be that person that gives up. You could be just what they want.\u201d JD does not have the best voice and Sondheim is notoriously hard to sing but JD absolutely OWNED  that role. I could never see a better actor for that movie despite the absolute fact there are thousands of better singers. \n\nThis is a roundabout way of saying\u2026his music with Jeff and HV isn\u2019t my cup of tea either.

Depp looks to have dropped a lot of weight- I think that\u2019s mainly because he isn\u2019t drinking to numb the pain of being abused by Heard or dragged through the gutter by the media. Yes, he broke his ankle recently, which meant he was limping a bit, but alcohol bloat is a thing and he\u2019s obviously cleaned up a lot since the court case and is able to enjoy his life. I also think he\u2019d put a bit of weight on to play the role of King Louis in that movie, so he\u2019s definitely looking fitter overall.\n\nMore importantly, he looks years younger as he hasn\u2019t got the weight of the world and all that toxicity bearing down on him.",

What will convince the effing media to stop going not only against public opinion but against truth and evidence?\n\nI had never realized before this, the sheer, unadulterated arrogance of the media that seeks to shape public opinion regardless of the truth.   Used to be a time when they were supposed to report the news.  Now it seems that they want to invent the news, as they see fit.

He is doing well, and that's fantastic.  He made his point and won the court of public opinion (as well as his court case).  He is still a brand ambassador for Dior and was never dropped.  Hollywood will eventually come crawling back to him.  He is too much of a money-maker for them to ignore him forever.\n\nBut there remains this damn shadow.  A dung heap pile of biased documentaries about him.",

It also, again, begs the question - why then? If he truly was guilty, ala Weinstein, is he still respected and working (and you cannot use the argument of \u2018power\u2019 here - Weinstein had much more power re: Hollywood careers than Depp ever had, no?) whilst she\u2019s become a pariah - especially in the era of \u2018believe all women\u2019 we STILL didn\u2019t believe her\u2026 Be at peace man, JD is and thats enough for those of us that wanted justice for him\u2026 \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\udc9b",

But the insurance companies have no such qualms.\n\nAnyway, I think that she expected things to go her way, following the absurd UK trial.  The judge believed her, and that gave her confidence another trial would go her way as well.  She probably got some advice from lawyers that defamation cases were very difficult to win.",

They're looking at the lack of evidence and saying that it's all fine, that Amber must be correct because she's a woman, that there are logical reasons for the pictures not matching up.\n\nHere's the thing about her injuries. Broken noses take between two to six weeks to heal, according to what I'm finding online. I'm a little skeptical about the two week thing, but it is what it is. That said, there would likely still be at least a *little* swelling in the t-zone area of her face and there appears to be *none* in these pictures. I want it to make sense, but it doesn't seem like it ever will.\n\nI've seen someone with two black eyes before. One of Bam Margera's friends *let him* give him two black eyes on... I want to say it was \"Bam's Unholy Union\"? Anyway, dude's eyes were completely swollen shut and it seems like they stayed that way for several days. So all this shit about Amber getting attacked and then going out the very next day, but looking normal because of makeup? That's some stinky ass bullshit right there.",

No one told her that it's not who you date or marry, A-list status also requires talent, which she doesn't have. \n\nIn the \"suck my d!*k\" audio, Johnny stands up for himself when he says, \"Think about what you have to offer instead of just getting your tits out\", \"Yeah... I'M the joke in the industry!!!\", \"I'm thinking that you've been giving some of your best performances and they're a f-ing tragedy\"..... Some people may think this is verbal abuse from Johnny, but this is after years of psychological, verbal and physical abuse at the hands of his wife. This is After she threw a vodka bottle that severed the tip of his finger.. This is After she attacked him on their honeymoon ...  This is After she attacked him for spending \"too much time at Isaac's\", only to chase him into a bathroom, kick a door into his head, and punch him, afterwards, he left, and she sent him 59 texts in 2 hours before turning up at his doorstep, demanding to \"talk \".... This is After she attacked him because he was asked not to escort her on the red carpet at The Danish Girl Premiere because he didn't want to steal the limelight from the stars of the movie.... This is after she threw a full bottle of iced tea at the back of his head, he left,l again, and then she sent him 25 texts before texting him, \"I'm outside the house trying to get in\"...  This is After she attacked him on December 15th AND threw a can of mineral spirits at his nose on the island... This is not \"verbal abuse\", this is Johnny Finally standing up for himself to this psychotic monster that he loved. \n\nHe tried to give her advice and help her career. Hell, he Got her Aquaman. But, she still hated that he was loved more than her.",

Drunk or not, you are not running and twisting your torso like that even 4 weeks after. Drunk does not mean you aren\u2019t going to notice when your lungs twinge from pain bad enough you gasp or loose breath. It may lessen the pain, but it does not mean your not going to notice breathing changes. Bruised bones are often considered worse pain wise than broken ones. (And that has been my experience.) Not every bruise will show up on the skin (I have several right now on my shins that are bruised w/o visible signs of it). However, a broken nose, busted lip etc. are going to bruise. A beating of that level, you are going to be purple for a while, and have a long recovery ahead of you. Even if the bruising has subsided, you are still extremely sore, and is still going to be pain. Don\u2019t get me started on the claims of injuries or incidents that would have not only automatically landed her a trip to an ER, but in an ICU. Yet no trips exist and she was not in a hospital when she absolutely would have. Making claims about things that would have led to an ICU stay, an extended hospital stay, and serious surgeries to rectify what actually would have happened is\u2026 infuriating.",

Wouldn\u2019t the average thinking woman who\u2019d been raped seek medical help IMMEDIATELY in the event it did some damage? It was 2015? Hardly there can be no shame in this day and age to seek advice. Dr Kipper who was their concierge doctor was there. So there would be no worry of a leak to anyone if he and his nurse examined her. I don\u2019t pretend to know Depp\u2019s security but I can\u2019t imagine any of them knowing if he had in fact penetrated her with a bottle hence what she said raped that any of them would have stuck around. Am I making sense here ? She was stoned out of her mind on a myriad of booze and drugs how in the hell did she dream up that he raped her? This woman is far far more Ill than we even know",

I'm willing to bet that most women would seek medical treatment just for the pain and fear of infection or permanent damage alone. she could have used a fake name plus she was in Australia at the time no one would have known it was her. plus patients have privacy with their medical professionals that rape kit or obgyn exam would not be released to the public.\n\nHer defense also tried to say she could take all this pain and suffering because she was raised with horses \ud83d\udc80 which was probably the funniest part.",

Who knows what she was legitimately on and what she was self medicating with. There was always an attempted tone set by her team that everyone was bought off around him. What was the goofy thing she said \u2018curry favor\u2019 ?  She was horrible to the man. But what does it all matter when I just now read that 98 percent of pro-Depp people were bots. This was a case that obviously hit a nasty chord with heard fans. Elaine saying the jury was tainted by the internet is one of the most egregious things I\u2019ve heard. She has no proof of that.

        "post_text": "I know we\u2019re all of two minds with the upcoming Netflix doc: Ignore it or prepare to counter it for those with renewed interest and who didn\u2019t watch the trial. \n\nI\u2019m in the latter group to an extent, so I\u2019m rewatching the trial and depos to bring facts to the fight \u2014 especially on Twitter, which is a cesspool of bots and AH supporters. \n\nUsually with allegations (even as we\u2019re currently seeing with Wooten or Lizzo), the floodgates open \u2014 sometimes credible claims, other times not so much. Would JD be the first in recent times where, as Ben Chew eloquently put it in closing, there\u2019s no Me Too? Have I missed any accusations? For a man who\u2019s been famous for as long as I\u2019ve been alive, that\u2019s rare. As a teen, I heard about certain actors and execs and casting couches\u2026DV claims. Even with his substance abuse issues, there weren\u2019t any stories about him being out of control with people \u2014 just property for the most part. I know there was the Brooks situation, but that seemed justified TBH.\n\nAnyhoo, from 2016 up until weeks after the trial, I was holding my breath, wondering who else would come forward. It just hasn\u2019t happened. Again, all smoke from one person but no fire. Do AH\u2019s supporters ever consider this? I know it\u2019s possible for him to have done that to just one person, but what about the women she named \u2014 like Kelly Sue, the flight attendant, or Kate Moss? Keep in mind, no one from her former circle is coming forward to substantiate her claims either. I haven\u2019t seen his former co-stars stand with her publicly. \n\nAccusers come forward all the time when one person speaks out \u2014 even if sometimes it\u2019s a lie or just a cash grab. The fact no one has said, hey, I\u2019m the flight attendant whose wrist he grabbed or the girl by the campfire who figured out how many pounds of pressure speaks volumes. No Tabloid stories. Nothing. I know they want folks to believe he\u2019s powerful and pays people off, but he\u2019s not that darn rich and certainly not powerful since he couldn\u2019t rescue his own career at the time. \n\nYet the person they support is the only one with a reputation and whose prior DV abuse is documented. How do they contend with that fact? That despite using drugs and alcohol in the past, he restrained himself in every single relationship and encounter. Somehow he waited until he was attached to all these mega film franchises, at an older age, and he started abusing her right away \u2014 over a tattoo coverup that every pop culture enthusiast knew about in the \u201890s?! Make it make sense. \n\nI\u2019m glad he won, and it was televised. But I pray one day he is truly vindicated \u2026 no gray area or misleading docuseries focusing on the fanfare and not the facts. The ones covering and looking their noses down at YouTubers who dared to stream this trial are the same ones who followed OJ, Casey Anthony, Elizabeth Holmes, Tory Lanez, etc. \n\nIf that\u2019s the angle Netflix wants to play, why not rise above the fray and let the both of them be?\n\nSide note: I loathe AH\u2019s supporters using Megan Thee Stallion for their own rhetoric and personal gain. Only one victim there, and their situations couldn\u2019t be more different.",

I was tickled pink that Eve's stupid stunt ended up costing them 30 minutes they could have used to cross Kate Moss.\n\nAlso, I believe it.  They were in a hurry, it was an emerging situation and they probably didn't see there was no date and accepted what Eve said.  The reason I think that is that Rottenborn had egg on his face, and both attorneys embarrassed themselves in front of the judge.  I doubt that the testimony of Gina was so pivotal that they would have done that, and risk being censured.",

Unfortunately, the only way I think he could ever be vindicated is if someone from her camp (a former friend or someone close to the situation) comes out and confirms she made this up. It'd have to amount to a Jussie situation. You'd think cops not seeing anything, the Morgans as outside witnesses, and minimal evidence from her despite these grandiose claims would do it -- but no. They have a parasocial relationship with her and are unwilling to adjust their priors about her.   \n\n\nI have posted in this sub that the op-ed angered me, but not as much as what went down in 2016. When I saw the photos of her the next day with Rocky, I screamed. I don't like anyone weaponizing the legal system for personal gain and publicity. I believe that it was made up and used to advance herself in the divorce. She would've settled for that $7 million but then came Me Too. She just couldn't stand all the other actresses being championed and felt left out since she came forward first in 2016. Remember the tweets from her friends around that time in response to Alyssa Milano and Rose McGowan getting coverage? Such a narcissist.   \n\n\nI wish that Netflix would've just shown the case with experts and let people make up their minds (again). Focusing on the YouTubers and social media coverage is cowardly. My hope is that people are so fatigued by it all they won't watch, but I know that's not likely. It might not be today or tomorrow, but the truth always comes to the light. I choose to believe -- until there's reason not to -- that the truth (not his truth or \"her truth\" like she always says) prevailed in that case. She's going to wrong the wrong person, and those skeletons about this whole thing are gonna spill out.",

And that Wino story is the first one that stood out to me! The prelude to it felt more genuine but then as soon as she goes into the details of the Wino tattoo story it all begins to feel so fake and sound more like a 13 year old's idea of an 'edgy' fanfiction than anything that happens in real life. Having witnessed real violence all my life I have a really hard time swallowing that Wino tatoo story.",

I read and write a lot, so sometimes it just seeps into my own work and conversations. We had enough foolishness from her to not water things down with that or her sniffing coke on the stand lol. That said, I believed her testimony right up until this story. The horse breaking and her background seemed plausible to me. The only thing that ever rang true to me was her hurt from his disappearing act (even if it was to de-escalate) and her disgust with his substance abuse issues.  \n\n\nHowever, as someone who does write for a living, the minute she started telling this tattoo story, it didn't pass the smell test. I do believe she joked with him about it. Maybe he got mad. Maybe he didn't. Doesn't really matter. He's entitled to be upset about a joke or taunting of his past. Even then, she downplayed what she said. In fact, she never really told the jury (or in her depo) the things she said. It was always, I can't remember what I said. But then she'd be able to remember affectations, carpet/flooring, the environment, and mimic how he sounded when he supposedly did these things. That's odd.   \n\n\nIt was too narrated. She told stories as if she were someone on the sideline and not reliving it. Who talks that way? Why does the jury need to know that she ran to her car and saw her breath on the window (in California of all places lol) after you just told them he smacked you about this tattoo thing? That's what good writers do. They show; they don't tell. Because the writer/narrator knows we have to be able to utilize our five senses when we're reading stories we're not present for or that are made up. The carpet and breath on the window was a red flag to me. It all went downhill after that.",

That's the image she gives everyone, that he beat her up, you think of hitting, etc.\n\nHe admitted to shoving, pushing, her.  I can imagine she might have lost her footing and fell once or twice.  But what was the context of it?   Was he pushing her after she had pushed him?   Was she blocking a doorway or elevator (which testimony said she often did) and he shoved her out of the way to get by?    Was she getting up in his face or trying to push herself on him (\"c'mon baby, let me see your eyes....\"\\_ and he pushes her back?\n\nI can see him backing her against a wall and saying \"don't even start....\"\n\nI can see him holding her down on a bed and saying he's not letting her up until she calms down (like she had started with the hitting and/or kicking).\n\nI can see him grabbing and holding her arms, or in a bear hug, to stop her attacks.\n\nI also think that if he ever thought she was hurt (like with her toes under the door), he would immediately have made sure she was okay, it would have taken any \"anger\" away from him for the moment, to make sure she was okay.   But there is also the fact that he got so he didn't believe her when she said she was \"hurt\" -- nose bleed, cell phone hit her, etc.\n\nI think it was Dr. Cowan's notes on the \"headbutt\" incident, where she told him - when she went to his office -  they got into a shoving/pushing match, and that JD pushed first.  She mentions no headbutt that is in his notes (she refers to it in texts though).\n\nThey have one conversation on audio where JD is talking her through what happened in their last fight (think the door hit him in the back and she followed him to other room after telling him to get out, etc.) and they each have different memories of what happened.  She says she took an Ambien before it - which makes me wonder how many nights she took Ambien - and maybe that is why she remembers it differently.  She also said something like they are 2 different people, so of course they remember it differently.\n\nAnyway -- I just know I believe he never hit her.   In her very emotional states - which we heard on tape - maybe his grabbing her or holding her, pushing her, is to her a \"hit.\"   You really did have to catch on to how she used \"words\" and that you could not take the word used literally.   A \"hit\" could be where he said to her no one liked her, etc.",

If he has the support of the public, and he wants to move forward, he has no issues. He has been vindicated. Sure, there are Turd fans that won't believe AH was lying even if you took them back in time to witness every aspect of the events. This includes the planning to wreck JP by Turd. \n\nI think the best we can do for JP is to move forward. We support his work in what ever form he presents it, completely disregard Turd, and let her slip into the abyss of our collective forgettery. If nobody pays attention to the turd, it will eventually dry up and stop stinking. Or, put it in a plastic bag and discard it into the appropriate receptacle.  Either way, you don't stand there and give it your undying attention because it is not worth the time. JP however is. But I am pretty sure he'd rather we focus on what he is doing today, without invading his privacy, than what happened to him before. \n\nJust my thoughts. Love your work JP. And I will always be a fan and supporter. Because you deserve it.",

Remember, the subject is Domestic Violence, and also of Depp suing someone else.\n\n>Trashing a hotel room while with Kate Moss (she may not call him abusive, but trashing a place does fall under Domestic Violence)\n\nNo it doesn't. If it did, then Rage Rooms would be illegal.\n\n>Ellen Barkin claims he threw something at her.\n\nNo, she didn't. She specifically said it **wasn't** thrown at her, just thrown.\n\n>Aside from ex's\n\nThis is still just a list of one, and her name is Amber Heard.\n\n>Some examples: A hotel security guard\n\nThat was in 1989, he was 25, and it was a big fight involving multiple people when hotel security tried to break up a loud party. He plead guilty, and that was supposed to be wiped from his record as a first offense. Hmm...\n\n>A screw member on film set reported assault\n\nYeah. Brooks. That was the one where there were 6 other eye witnesses that corroborate Depp and say Brooks is lying through his teeth. Oh yeah, and there's security footage that shows that Brooks was lying.\n\n>A female fan reported being attacked and sexually assaulted by him and his bodyguards.\n\nYup. Tried to sue Depp after she used the wrong entrance to a concert, was escorted to her seat, then tried to get into the VIP section where Depp was without having a VIP ticket. She attempted to use her status as a handicapped individual to be allowed in. The bodyguards you are talking about were guards for the venue, not Depp's, and were off-duty police officers. Depp did not attack anyone. Fat surprise that that lawsuit *against* Depp didn't go anywhere.\n\n>Not quite the parade of accusers like some other celebs have endured, but looks like Amber certainly isn't the first to accuse him of being a violent dude.\n\nNot even the amount of accusers your precious \"queen\" has of *her* being abusive and violent. Your list is sad and proves absolutely nothing to your point.",

It\u2019s very hard to win  against a publication because you have to prove the publication knows their source (even anonymous sources or whistleblowers) is lying. I\u2019m a journalist. If a source or expert tells me something, I\u2019m just reporting what I was told. This wasn\u2019t an investigative report. Now, if that source comes to me and says, hey, let\u2019s call this story off because I haven\u2019t been truthful, and I still move forward with writing the story \u2014 then I can be held liable. Ahem, Stephen Glass.\n\nAll The Sun did was repeat her lies, which is why she was a witness in the case and not the defense. Also, I\u2019m not familiar with the UK court system, but I imagine it\u2019s as hard to prove libel there as it is here. Same with WaPo. That\u2019s why much of the WaPo article was padded with legislative measures that have been passed and not many anecdotes. They could prove those acts of legislation and minimally relied on her story. I\u2019m certain her team pitched her to outlets, and WaPo took the bait because of the political and social angle they could take with the piece. Otherwise, they wouldn\u2019t have looked in her direction \u2014 like the other publications. Notice many of them didn\u2019t start putting her on the cover until AFTER op-Ed. The 2016 allegations went by the wayside, and he was still working. \n\nThing that infuriates me about people like you and her supporters is that you\u2019re the loudest and wrongest ones and haven\u2019t even glanced at evidence. I don\u2019t argue in bad faith. It\u2019s disingenuous. Where is this laundry list of people he sued? His manager? Celebs do that all the time. What say you since she\u2019s the one who threatened to file a lawsuit first? What about her counterclaim? If he\u2019s sue happy, so is she.",

        "post_text": "I was *alerted* to this year old Quora thread in my email today. I am adding this to some SS of nonsense from her supporters. Their delusion is so strong. Sorry, Mike, there are millions of people out there who would have loved to be in Johnny\u2019s life. It so unfortunate that he became a target of her abuse. Amber is mentally unstable. She is walking around with an intentional misdiagnosis, and not seeking proper treatment.\n\nThis is just how unhinged they are, and we can\u2019t stop until she tells the truth. It\u2019s a lot so bear with me.\n\n1. How is makeup not going to cover the \u201cbruise above her eye\u201d, yet all of the swelling she claimed to have isn\u2019t evident? The darkness is EYESHADOW and it\u2019s symmetrical on both sides of her face. \ud83e\udd28\n\n2. She claimed her eyes were \u201cblackened\u201d surrounding the nose. So how does she have a \u201cbruise\u201d on her eyelid, but nothing in that T-Zone surrounding what should be a very bruised and swollen nose with bruises UNDER THE EYE consistent with breaking the nose? A swollen, broken, nose like she\u2019s claiming she had would\u2019ve been misshapen. Ice can\u2019t fix that. She also picks her lips a lot. We saw it several times during the trial.\n\n3. She\u2019s literally scratching her eyebrow. \ud83d\ude29\n\n4. She\u2019s \u201cclearly swollen\u201d? So under dimmer lighting we are going to see more than we did under retina burning lights? Did her ice just magically start wearing off? Or is that literally how her face looks? They just make things up.\n\n5. If she was so bruised and beaten like she claims, and her makeup artist had to spend hours and hours covering these bruises, and reducing swelling\u2026there would have been photographs. Let\u2019s be realistic. She submitted a photo of her bruised arm into evidence, which was the only authentic bruise we\u2019ve actually seen on her during the trial, and it wasn\u2019t even from the timeframe she said it was. Her hair color in that photo does not match her hair color from photos surrounding the date of that claim. The bruise on her arm could have been from anything or anyone at an earlier date.\n\nShe claims that she did have all these photos. \u201cMountains of evidence\u201d. \n\nIt\u2019s a lie. How do we know this a lie? She would have sold everything she had to TMZ, just like the kitchen video. She doesn\u2019t have anything to sell that can be authenticated because IT NEVER HAPPENED. \n\nShe didn\u2019t think she\u2019d have to answer questions so she told tall tales without thinking about when these claims were made. She was in the public eye far too often, and her claims are utterly unbelievable to anyone with critical thinking skills. Heavy metal rings with sharp edges and details would absolutely split skin. So she\u2019d have either sought medical attention and had stitches, or she\u2019d be heavily scarred. One hard punch can easily fracture an eye socket, and she claims she took repeated hits to the face on multiple occasions. Let\u2019s be real. She also took a \u201clarge square bottle to the pubic bone\u201d with only a little bleeding, and slept it off with sleeping pills. \ud83d\ude43\n\n6. She \u201cgoes trailer park real fast\u201d. It\u2019s stated in a way that might seem humorous to people, but it\u2019s not. She\u2019s admitting that violence is ingrained into her DNA. She\u2019s a \u201csurvivor\u201d, but it\u2019s a badge of honor to piss people off?? She talks about victims in a disdainful way. She was extremely offended when Camille called her a victim. The only difference between a victim and a survivor is that the victim has yet to be given the tools to become a survivor.\n \nBeing a victim isn\u2019t shameful, but she acted like it is.\n\n7. Finally, look at what followers of Ambuser had to say about Britney Spears, someone who has been exploited her entire life. \ud83d\ude12\ud83d\ude12\ud83d\ude24 I\u2019m not convinced that most of these people actually care about Amber, or abused women. They just use her as an excuse to be mean and hateful. They use her as a tool to continue to hate Johnny and spread misinformation out of pure contempt. They use her to continue to harass him and anyone who might support him or enjoy his movies. I wish we could silence every one of them.",

I wish I could add the photo here, but tell me why it is a line straight up from the eyebrow, whole eyelid is red, a perfect line of red down to the top of her cheekbone. Yet five days after that, at the courthouse, there was absolutely none of those spots bruised. It was randomly a spot on her cheek close to her nose. Even the photos from the same night don\u2019t match up. I suspect they were playing with makeup looks and angles; forgetting to discard the photos they didn\u2019t want to keep. I\u2019ve seen what damage people have done to themselves accidentally dropping their phones on their faces while in bed. Yet he chucked it at her face?",

And they're just a vocal minority who struggle to even get 10 upvotes then they write something supporting Turd, lol.",

If the shoe was on the other foot, no one would be defending Johnny Depp. What are they trying to do? They already canceled JD, and they are ensuring he never works for another Hollywood studio. I know he\u2019s not interested, but I\u2019m just saying. If they are trying to fix her reputation, fuck off and take their \ud83d\udd95 and stick it up their asses. It\u2019s been nearly a decade, and assholes just won\u2019t let this go and leave Johnny Depp the fuck alone. Gaslighting by telling us that we are dumb people and what we saw in that courtroom with our own eyes is all a lie. Blaming social media as if there wasn\u2019t a jury that came to the decision that AH defamed with malice. She sat on the fucking stand in right on front of the jury, and said JD is the reason she wrote the op-ed because he\u2019s a \u201cvery powerful man.\u201d She was speaking of his power. AH is the one with all of the power - she destructed on JD\u2019s life - yeah because beating on him daily and severing his finger just wasn\u2019t enough for this piece of dog doo doo shit. AH is fucking cancelled, and I don\u2019t see the point in trying to fix her rotten image. JD warned her about all of this - he said he didn\u2019t want to tarnish her name, but she just wouldn\u2019t stop. It makes no sense to even want to be around her. Who would want to work, and hang around someone that beats the lights out of you, film, record and take photos of you setting you up? I sure as hell wouldn\u2019t. She entirely too vicious, and should be in prison. \n\nIt\u2019s time to drop this madness - I\u2019m not understand why they keep pushing this horrific agenda and busted narrative. If it was an honest documentary, it would have all of the unedited audio recordings and her telling JD to tell the world he was abused by a woman and see how many believe him. It should also contain the famous not punching but hitting you audio. Yeah because that\u2019s a fucking shit load of difference. JD won PERIOD.\ud83d\udd95",

They were clearly not bruises.  Here SA story in Australia has so much evidence proving it never happened (an so many actually victims say no way could it have happened as she claimed) that it was laughable.  Yet, some still defend it. \n\nIt just goes with the rest of the world today.  People no longer care about reality.  They'll lie and act like anything no matter how impossible is true, or they are so brainwashed they'll believe anything that is impossible somehow is true.  It is actually very scary.",

And when people try to defend those 2 or lie and say they really were victims, they kill all credibility when they try to defend real victims. \n\nWhen a group of people who say they advocate for abuse victims, put a person on a pedestal who was arrest for domestic violence, who admitted hitting her spouse on multiple occasions, and admitted hitting her best friend in the face during an argument, it makes all abuse victims look bad.",

First of all, there never was one of those. Secondly, although there certainly was a strong underground movement on *social* media to expose AH as a false accuser/true abuser, I never got the impression that it was in any way a JD fan club project. \n\nDon't get me wrong; I saw Edward Scissorhands in the theater sitting next to my unrequited crush on when I was 14 (she was 16... as if!). You better believe something got in my eye, as it still does every time I watch it or think about it too long. But Danny Elfman is the real culprit there, and in any event, I can separate my feelings about a character from my feelings about their portrayer, as I imagine most grownups can. Capt. Jack Sparrow is iconic and beloved, sure, and the man who portrayed him has talent, wealth, fame, and power most can only dream of... but the same could have been said of Dr. Cliff Huxtable, and I don't recall any great groundswell of support for [America's former dad](https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/bill-cosby-scandal/bill-cosby-was-once-america-s-dad-now-he-s-n869396). Or for the [Frugal Gourmet](https://www.mashed.com/1320010/shameful-downfall-frugal-gourmet/), as long as I'm dating myself here. While I don't know if Harvey Weinstein ever had what you'd call *fans*, he had massive wealth and power, and it didn't matter. Kevin Spacey, though, was more acclaimed as an actor than JD ever was, and though he had no Jack Sparrow role, Kaiser S\u00f6ze and John Doe are [iconic AF](https://www.cnn.com/2015/08/14/entertainment/usual-suspects-movie-keyser-soze-feat/index.html)\u2014especially, one imagines, among the incellular pro-wifebeater demographic\u2014but you don't see #justiceforkevinspacey.\n\nThis was never a movement of Capt. Jack Sparrow ride-or-dies. I don't even know if there were any JD stans before the truth started coming out; JD was always too private and his characters too multifarious and idiosyncratic to be relatable in the way that builds a rabidly loyal stanbase. I suppose the same could be said of Kevin Spacey, but that's kind of the point: there's something else going on here, some further fact that accounts for the passionate intensity of pro-Depp sentiment.\n\nIt's the sheer abundance of evidence that AH is a perjuring, abusive slanderer and that JD, for all his faults, is anything *but* a wifebeater.\n\n\n\n* I do not, in fact love it at all.",

Stitched together to remove the worst moments. It was unbelievable. Had none of JD\u2019s evidence where he proved her wrong.

It'd be dumb not to exploit these free material to its last drop if you are in a business to create content.",

I still am to some degree, and it really, really pisses me off how this has gone with the media and social media. It's total bullshit. It isn't fair, and it's infuriating. However, aside from a few folk on twitter and maybe Facebook, everybody knows the truth. The media are in her pocket. Why? Not sure. Perhaps she, like Dan Wooton, has compromising information about very powerful people. They have no choice but to do what she says, or she can likely ruin their lives and reputation. It's almost Irene Adler behaviour from Sherlock. Of the thousands of comments on YouTube on the audio recordings, everyone agrees she's an abuser. Every comment on every article on any news source  everyone knows she's a dangerous liar. The truth is the truth, and we all know it. They do, too, but they can't be honest because she or others will destroy them. It's a dangerous game, being in the media. Don't worry about the liars or the tiny percentage of people who claim to be on her side. It's all lies and bollocks. Everyone knows the truth.",

There are 2 reasons that they may support her and that\u2019s it. Nothing to do with the trial, or the evidence. It\u2019s 1) They believe Amber because she\u2019s a woman, 2) They side with Amber because they don\u2019t like Johnny Depp. \n\nTry having a rational conversation with them about your opinions on the entire case and they will very quickly become hostile. I got banned from both of the Reddit accounts that support Amber simply for pointing out moments in which Amber lied or admitted to hitting Johnny, and got called every name under the sun.",

Most of us can blow off the things they say and chalk it up to them being a waste of space, but it\u2019s how they treat those who are vulnerable that really pisses me off.",

I can definitely agree that Johnny has made a lot of mistakes in life, and the way he spoke about her and to her in some situations was inexcusable but there is clear evidence that Amber was the aggressor in the relationship and Johnnys evidence that he had been assaulted by her was way more believable than everything she was claiming. What makes Amber so detestable is how she tried to garner praise and admiration by claiming she was a victim of domestic violence. She put herself on a pedestal as a survivor and someone to look up to, when the reality is that she has a history of violent outbursts and is not a voice for domestic violence survivors. \n\nI can be fine with anyone who doesn\u2019t like Johnny Depp as a person, I\u2019d understand that. But anyone trying to label him as an abuser I can not understand.",

There was a lot of motivated reasoning going on during the coverage of the trial on both sides, but I think for Heard supporters in particular, it was more blatant because of how their relationship challenged the typical dynamics of abuse that the public had become accustomed to hearing about on the news in recent years.",
